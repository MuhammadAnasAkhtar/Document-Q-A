# Document Q&A Application
# Overview
The Document Q&A Application is a tool designed to answer questions based on the context provided in a text file. By leveraging a pre-trained question-answering model, users can upload a document, input a question, and receive precise answers extracted from the document's content.

# Features
Context-Based Question Answering: Upload a text document, input a question, and get answers directly derived from the file's content.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
Powerful Model: Utilizes deepset/roberta-base-squad2, a fine-tuned model for question-answering tasks.
# How It Works
Upload a Document: Provide a .txt file containing the context.
Ask a Question: Enter a question related to the uploaded document's content.
Receive an Answer: The application processes the input and returns an answer based on the provided context.
# Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.

# Model Details
Model Used: deepset/roberta-base-squad2
Task: Extractive Question Answering
Source: Hugging Face Transformers library
# Limitations
Only supports .txt files for context input.
Performance depends on the quality of the uploaded document and clarity of the question.
# Future Enhancements
Support for additional file formats (e.g., PDF, Word).
Add multi-language support for documents and questions.
Implement advanced context visualization for better user interaction.
# Example
Input:
Document: A .txt file containing an excerpt about climate change.
Question: "What are the causes of global warming?"
Output:
Answer: "The causes of global warming include greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation."
